# Tutorial-CDM
Materials necessary for the "OMOP Common Data Model & Standardized Vocabularies Tutorial".  This tutorial will discuss all the details on the structure of the OMOP-CDM and the Standardized Vocabularies that are used to harmonize terminology. There are no pre-requisite courses.

## Description & Objectives 
This course will give an introduction into the history of Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) and the birth of Observation Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI). It highlights OHDSI’s vision as well as how OHDSI is trying to drive the future of observational research through network studies. All of this introduction lays the importance for the rest of the course’s material. 

The course will then move on to understanding the OMOP Vocabularies; it is important to understand how the Vocabulary is used and work through examples prior to moving on to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The final portion of the course will explain in detail the layout of the CDM as well as some key concepts such as era logic.

After successful completion of this course students should understand why the OMOP Vocabulary is important to the OHDSI standardization process and conceptually understand how to navigate it. Additionally, students will understand the structure of the OMOP CDM and how one might conduct observational research using it. This course will not go into detail on how to perform a transformation into the CDM (commonly referred to the Extract, Transform, & Load (ETL) process) nor will it explore in detail OHDSI tools such as ATLAS.
